# ao -- a decentralized governance model for running an autonomous organziation with shared resources


Webserver and backend for Autonomous Organization: bitcoin enabled flat hierarchy, community ownership. To setup follow the instructions at (https://github.com/dctrl-ao/ao/tree/master/install).

The aim is to provide fully transparent management of commons space and resources. It provides a user interface to see and create current members. Each member is given a fob that can be scanned by raspberry pi based readers. Members are required to keep there account up to date to maintain access.

The community can create Tasks which are an attempt to be fair to the members of the community that are maintaining the commons. Tasks can be claimed through the UI or by tapping a task fob, then a member fob on any resource point.

The community can create Resources (https://github.com/dctrl-ao/fobtap) that monitor access to the space and can be hacked to distribute resources. The first example of this idea is an overidden 1960's vending machine. We are also experimenting with implementing a kegorator.
